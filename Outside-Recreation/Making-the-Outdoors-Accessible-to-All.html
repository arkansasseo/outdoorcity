<p>Games that utilize tossing skills are popular with mobile seniors and can easily be modified to accommodate people confined to wheelchairs. Set up a horseshoe set--preferably a lightweight plastic version--in an easily accessible area outdoors. <img style="max-width: 20%; margin: 4px;" src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._HImYGIyybIFH3oiDwkqlAHaE8" alt="outdoor" align="right" /> A simpler tossing game consists of using beanbags to toss through a cut-out hole in a box, or another target, such as a hula hoop resting on the ground. Also consider making a ring toss game from a weighted-down bottle or peg and plastic or rope rings.</p>
<h2 id="2">Fun Party Games for Kids</h2>
<p>Any time you have a gathering of kids, it is a good idea to have some games planned. <img style="max-width: 50%; margin: 5px;" src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.rg2H2KrMzxLd3gtJNcXWHAHaE7" alt="activities" align="left" /> But what about if you do not have any equipment with you? have no fear, there are several games kids can play without equipment and they will have all the fun they can handle.</p>
<p>There is no better way to interact with nature and enjoy it with your family than to have a nice cozy picnic. Whether you do it by the lakeside, in the meadows, or in a park, it is a fantastic way to unwind while keeping the kids entertained. No, you not only have to sit and eat sandwiches. You can make your picnic even more memorable by playing fun games like volleyball, catch, or a three-legged race.</p>
<p>With the old fashioned kids games that we played, we had to use our imaginations, in many cases. We usually made our own fun, and it was most often done outdoors. Even when it rained, we played in garages and carports. We didn&rsquo;t stay indoors like kids do today. If we did, our moms found something to occupy us &ndash; something we didn&rsquo;t like doing: cleaning our rooms, cleaning out our closets, sweeping, etc.</p>
<p>Outdoor physical education activities like sports require equipment, but you can easily set up and play them in a yard or nearby park. Fun pe games for kids like soccer, kickball, or basketball can be played with just a ball at a nearby park. Games like &ldquo;h-o-r-s-e" or "around the world&rdquo; can be played with just two or more players on a basketball court. Net sports like tennis, volleyball, and badminton are great pe games for kids. Many public parks have tennis courts you can use, but you can also set up outdoor volleyball or badminton in the grass.</p>
