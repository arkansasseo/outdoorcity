 Games that utilize tossing skills are popular with mobile seniors and can easily be modified to accommodate people confined to wheelchairs. Set up a horseshoe set--preferably a lightweight plastic version--in an easily accessible area outdoors. A simpler tossing game consists of using beanbags to toss through a cut-out hole in a box, or another target, such as a hula hoop resting on the ground. Also consider making a ring toss game from a weighted-down bottle or peg and plastic or rope rings.

 Composting banana peels is as easy as simply tossing your leftover banana peels into the compost. You can toss them in whole, but be aware that they may take longer to compost this way. While, yes, you can use banana peels as fertilizer and it will not harm your plant, it is best to compost them first. Not only can you compost tea bags as fertilizer in the compost bin, but loose leaf teas and compostable tea bags may be dug in around plants. Using tea bags in compost adds that nitrogen-rich component to the compost, balancing the carbon-rich materials.

              <p class="card-text">What Is the Best Container Gardening Soil? 
 Many people wonder, "What is the&nbsp;best soil for container gardening?" when they first begin container gardening. One of the most common mistakes people make when establishing container gardens is failing to invest in high-quality potting soil. Consider the potting soil in your container garden to be the primary source of nutrition for those plants. Feeding your plants low-cost, non-organic soil from a large corporation is akin to feeding your body junk food. It will only get you so far before you start feeling awful. 
 So, what is the best soil for container gardens? One that contains organic nutrients and can drain efficiently while keeping the soil's moisture and ph balances in check. 
 Most potting soil lacks readily available nutrients for your plants, necessitating their supplementation. The vast majority of plants will require fertilizer to grow, which must be applied to your soil. Potting soil can be amended with a slow-release fertilizer. To accomplish this, either mix a large amount of potting soil with fertilizer in a bucket or fill your pot with potting soil before adding the fertilizer. 
 It is not a good idea to fill your pots with dirt from your garden or purchased dirt. Fill the containers with a moisture-retaining, compaction-resistant container potting mix. I usually add a heaping spoonful of granular organic fertilizer and a shovelful of compost. 
 It is critical to choose the appropriate</p>

 Preppers, hikers, campers and other folks of an outdoor persuasion are constantly fussing over their backpacks. There is no chore too boring, no job too big, and no task too great for folks who rely on their packs to get them through the day, and they will stop at nothing for any improvement, for any enhancement or any advantage. 
 This is all entirely reasonable, as the backpack is essential for any outdoor activity more demanding than a pleasurable stroll across the prairie. 
 
 
 
 Accordingly, everybody has heard the same, old, tired advice by now on reducing weight, packing properly and choosing the right bag in the first place. It is time to step your game up a little bit, and get even more from the pack and load you already have!
